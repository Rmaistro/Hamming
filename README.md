# Hamming
Hamming (UU '24/'25) by Jelle, Nena, Xander
Both the ”Hamming 7 4 code.py” (the matrix implementation) and ”Hamming 7 4 bitwise.py”
(the bitwise implementation) have a print statement that is called, every time one
runs the document. This block of code can be found on the lines 229-242 and the
lines 207-220 respectively. These blocks are identical, for the reason that the func-
tions in both documents have the exact same names: a significant advantage of the
use of many functions. The input function gives the following question:
”Type ’analysis’ if you want to perform an complexity analysis, type
’codecheck’ if you want to check wether or not the code works, type
’encrypt’ if you want to encrypt a message or ’decrypt’ if you want to
decrypt and if needed correct a message: ”
In other words, there are four choises that the user can make. If a correctly spelled
answer is provided, the program will run the code that, as said in the message, a
follow-up question might be presented. The four options will be covered in an order
so that is logical for the reader: encrypt, decrypt, checkcode and analysis.
